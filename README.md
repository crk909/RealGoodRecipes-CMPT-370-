## Name
Real Good Recipes

## Description
This is the source code for a website created in a group project for CMPT 370 - Software Engineering
It is a recipe sharing website that allows users to create and upload recipes, and also view others recipes to save for future reference
  This project was originally created on git.cs.usask server, and issues with permissions made porting the actual project over difficult 
  The original project is at https://git.cs.usask.ca/chw412/cmpt370 . Unfortunately I don't think it is viewable without a University of Saskatchewan account
  
## Usage
Website can be visited at https://realgoodrecipes.in/
Here is a demo account set up, feel free to use it to view the website without having to make an account
User: demo Pass: expass

## Roadmap
Since the implementation of this, I've learned a lot more about Web Development, so I will probably come back and re-make this using better suited technologies, node.js for example
